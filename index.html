<p>Every four years our district must renew school levies to continue vital programs and staff positions not covered by the state.  Our current levies expire in 2022, so we’re asking the community to consider renewing two levies in the February 8 Special Election, needed to sustain funding for the next four years (2023-2026).</p>

<p>The state pays for “basic education,” which is just the basics. Our Educational Programs & Operations (EP&O) Levy supports vital student programs beyond “basic” like music, art, athletics, after school clubs, electives and career exploration. One out of every five staff positions in our district are funded by the levy. This includes many counselors, nurses, specialized teachers, coaches and advisors, school security, and paraeducators as well as operational costs for these programs. Our Technology Levy covers about 80% of our district’s technology needs including hardware devices for all, tech staff, training, software and connectivity.</p>

<p>We offer some of the best educational programs and services on the Eastside, but our current levy generates $600 less per student ($4.3 million less overall) than our neighbors. Continuing to maintain our high-quality opportunities with an extremely competitive labor market, growing inflation and supply chain issues requires an adjustment to our levies – adjustments that many neighboring districts have already made. The two proposed replacement levies would bring our dollars per student up to close to the average of other districts in our region.</p>

<p>To make that adjustment, the overall school tax rate per $1000 of assessed value for the EP&O and Tech levies combined is estimated to be $0.21 higher than it was in 2021. However, our combined local rate for schools (levies and bonds) will be close to the average of what it has been over the past decade, since our bond rate is going down.</p>

<p>We know many families move to Snoqualmie Valley so their children can receive an excellent education, enjoy rich learning opportunities and activities, and be served by staff who care for them and take a personal interest in their lives. They also expect up-to-date and reliable technology for their students. Local levy funding is what makes that a reality.</p>

<p>Vote YES!</p>
